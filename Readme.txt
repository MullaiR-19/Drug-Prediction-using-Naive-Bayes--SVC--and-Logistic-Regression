##Drug Prediction using Naive Bayes, SVC, and Logistic Regression

This project is aimed at predicting the potential drug that can be prescribed to a patient based on their medical history. The dataset used for this project contains information about patient's pre-existing medical conditions.

The project is implemented using Python and scikit-learn library. Three classification algorithms - Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVC), and Logistic Regression are used to predict the drug that is most suitable for a patient. 

The Naive Bayes algorithm is based on the Bayes theorem and works on the principle of conditional probability. It is a simple algorithm that can handle large datasets with high accuracy.

SVC is a powerful algorithm that works well with both linear and non-linear data. It is useful when there are multiple features and classes in the dataset.

Logistic Regression is a popular algorithm used for binary classification problems. It works by fitting a logistic curve to the data and provides a probability of the outcome.

The project is divided into three parts - data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. In the data preprocessing phase, the data is cleaned, and feature engineering is performed to extract meaningful features from the dataset. In the model building phase, the algorithms are trained on the preprocessed data, and the best algorithm is selected based on the evaluation metrics. In the evaluation phase, the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated to determine the performance of the selected algorithm.

This project is useful for healthcare professionals and researchers who want to predict the most suitable drug for a patient based on their medical history. It demonstrates the use of three popular classification algorithms and can be extended to include other algorithms and datasets.
